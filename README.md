# Field Statistics Plugin for QGIS 3
A simple statistics plugin developed by Orden Aitchedji, McKenna Duzac, Andreas Foulk, and Tanner Lee.
This plugin was developed with the guidance of Brian Krzys as part of our CSM 2018 summer session.
### Tests
The unit_test dir contains our unit tests for statistics.  Run these tests with the following command:

```
python -m unit_test.statTests
```

The test dir contains test generated from https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pluginbuilder/
### Usage information in progress
Running install.sh should install the plugin on a macOS or Linux machine, provided pyrcc5 is installed.
